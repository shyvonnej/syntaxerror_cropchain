BREAKDOWNS OF THE THEME
Problem Statement:
- A solution to address issues related to the supply chain for small agricultural enterprises with moderate to large quantity demands.

Requirements:
1. Small agricultural enterprises act as supplier.
2. Real-time and accurate supply chain management system.

GUIDELINES
Breakdown of Problem:
The lack of traceability in the agricultural supply chain, making it difficult to identify the source of issues and take corrective action.

Solutions
With real-time tracking and monitoring of products, the agribusiness can show how a product from the farm to the shelf was handled with the strictest of adherence to organic principles.

CROP CHAIN
CropChain is designed to address the issues related to the supply chain for small agricultural enterprises with moderate to large quantity demands. With the help of Flutter, MySQL, and PHP, CropChain provides real-time data for inventory management, enabling small agricultural enterprises to act as suppliers directly, without the need for middlemen.

CropChain stands out from other solutions in the market by providing a user-friendly interface that allows easy access to inventory management and supply chain data. With the use of real-time data, small agricultural enterprises can make informed decisions about their inventory and reduce waste. Additionally, CropChain eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing transparency in the supply chain.

By using CropChain, small agricultural enterprises can focus on their core competencies and have better control over their supply chain. The CropChain solution is flexible, customizable, and can be scaled up or down according to business needs.

SOLUTIONS PROPOSED
1. Track the movement of produce from farm to market.
2. Scan a QR code on their products to see where it was grown, when it was harvested and how it was transported.
3. Provide farmers with data on market demands.
4. Facilitate collaboration between farmers, suppliers, and retailers.
